\section{{\faUser} About Me}
I'm a 24 year old Fullstack Engineer with a passion for back end development, tooling, automation and cloud computing. I love to muck around
with all sorts of weird and wonderful tech, no matter how bleeding edge. \\
I'm also an avid video game enthusiast who loves a good book as well as a bit of a music snob, who likes to mess around with a DJ controller in his spare time.
