\section{{\faUser} About Me}
I'm a 27 year old software engineer with a knack for getting software teams running like well oiled machines. During my 
career I have filled a variety of different roles, which has helped me to discover that I am truly passionate about 
enabling other developers to perform efficiently through the use of automation and intelligent tooling.
\\~\\
In my spare time I'm an avid video game enthusiast, and a jiu-jitsu practitioner. I'm also a self-described music
snob, who can usually be found either at the record store, the pub or in my house messing around with turntables.
